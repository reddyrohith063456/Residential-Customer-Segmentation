## Key Highlights

- Applied **K-Means Clustering** to segment 38,000 customer records into 5 clusters.
- Used **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to identify top influencing features.
- Conducted **Chi-Square Tests** for feature selection of categorical variables.
- Performed **sub-clustering** to capture granular rural and urban diversity.
- Regional analysis focused on Nevada, Florida, and Vermont for targeted recommendations.
- Visualized and presented insights using **Tableau dashboards** and **Python modeling**.
